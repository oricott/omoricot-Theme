I made a new repository (this one) all because the updater annoyed the living shit out of me.

##  1. How to ask for help
there will NOT be any support as i cannot be bothered and dont have the time to do such things. i made the theme just for the funnies and nothing more. If you know your way around coding, then feel free to do whatever you want.

## 2. Installing a theme


## 3. Customize your theme
All themes are provided with images & color, but you can easily customize your theme by following these steps

METHOD 1: Editing the theme file

* Step 1: Open the theme file using any text editor, notepad can be hard to read, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) are good options!
* Step 2: Find the ":root" part, this is where all color and images are defined, it may look like this:

* Step 3: Change the values to your liking
   * For images, replace the link, it must be a direct link (www.website.com/exemple-img.png) (you can use .png/.jpg/.jpeg/.gif)
   * For colors, replace the color code, you can use this website to get color codes(https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)

METHOD 2: Using Gibbu's theme editor, this tool lets you edit Discord themes without any programming skills required!
